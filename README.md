## Custom RGB colors on MSI Interceptor DS100

This is a proof of concept for making MSI Interceptor DS100 glow any color.

The default control panel given by MSI has 6 hardcoded colors, but it turns out the hardware has capability to glow any color.

By default the code will make mouse stop responding until Control-C is used, this is to both reflect what original program is doing and prevent random cursor movements.

# Epilepsy Warning
The default demo for this PoC uses quickly transitioning colors, as such if you have epilepsy problems you should either reconfigure the constants for your liking or modify the source code.

# Disclaimer
This uses a reverse engineered protocol, while it has been tested throughly, Iâ€™m not responsible for any damage this code might do to your device or computer.
